            <div class ="text-overlay4">This Image is of a Python program that I created in my first sesmester of the program. The program is about a car dealership and it takes all of the info inputted including the prices and creates a receipt and uses some math to do calculations. This program could be done more complex and used in an actual car dealership to create a nice user friendly experience for the person working there.</div>

            <div class ="text-overlay5">This Image is the final receipt that I did up to show how easy and well structured the program is. This program even has code which does not allow the user to "break" it and forces them to use characters that would be proper for said input. It even has a built in clock that makes the date of the invoice the current day that it was done no matter when you were to do it.</div>
