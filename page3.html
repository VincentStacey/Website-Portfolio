            <div class ="text-overlay6">The first image depicts a web interface that I created titled "Dog Image Gallery." This gallery allows users to select a dog breed and specify the number of images they wish to generate. The breed "beagle" is selected, and 11 images are generated and displayed in a grid. Each image showcases a beagle in various settings, including outdoors, on the couch, and during different activities. The overall layout appears to be user-friendly, with a clear selection process and a grid display of the dog images.</div>

            <div class ="text-overlay7">The second image is a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code editor which was used for the above application. It displays the code for a BreedSelector React component. The component fetches a list of dog breeds from an API (https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all) using useEffect and fetch. It then populates a dropdown menu with these breeds. The user can select a breed, triggering a handleChange function that updates the selected breed's state. The code is well-organized and appears to be part of a larger application related to dog breeds and image generation.</div></div>
